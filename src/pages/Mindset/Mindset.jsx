      example: "Weather Map App started with just location + current temp. No fancy UI, no 10-day forecast. Users loved it. Then I added features based on what they actually asked for.",

              When AgroStack helps a farmer get 30% better yields, that's not because I used React and Django. 
              It's because I understood that farmers needed real-time market data to make better decisions.
